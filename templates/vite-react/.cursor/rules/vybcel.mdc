## Project Context

This is a vybcel project template with:

- **Live Sync**: Changes are automatically synced to the cloud
- **Auto Deploy**: Every save triggers a deployment to your live preview
- **Modern Stack**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started

1. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `pnpm start` to start both dev server and sync service
   - This runs `pnpm dev` (local development) and `pnpm sync` (cloud sync) simultaneously
3. Edit files and see changes in both:
   - Local preview: `http://localhost:5173`
   - Live preview: Available in your Vybcel dashboard

### File Watching

- The `vybcel` npm package watches for file changes
- Changes are automatically sent to the Vybcel cloud platform
- Your live site updates automatically within 20-30 seconds

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   └── ui/           # shadcn/ui components
├── lib/
│   └── utils.ts      # Utility functions (cn, etc.)
├── App.tsx           # Main application component
├── main.tsx          # Application entry point
└── index.css         # Global styles with Tailwind
```

## Best Practices for Vybcel

### Performance

- Keep components small and focused
- Avoid heavy computations in components
- Use React.memo for expensive renders
- Optimize images and assets

### File Organization

- Keep all source code in `src/` directory
- Use the `@/` alias for imports from `src/`
- Group related components together
- Follow the established folder structure

### Vybcel Integration

- The `vybcel` package is automatically configured
- The sync service reads from `vybcel.config.json`
- Live preview URL is managed by the Vybcel platform
- Check the dashboard for deployment status

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start local development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm preview` - Preview production build locally
- `pnpm sync` - Start file sync service
- `pnpm start` - Start both dev and sync services
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

## Environment

- Node.js 18+ required
- Uses pnpm for package management
- Vite for fast development and building
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint for code quality

## Support

- Check the Vybcel dashboard for deployment logs
- Use the project settings in Vybcel web interface
- Restart sync service if connection issues occur: `pnpm sync`
- Contact Vybcel support for platform-specific issues
